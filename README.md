Curriculum for teaching programming using JavaScript and p5.js library

## Status

I'm after first edition of teaching programming with JavaScript and P5.js for one person. The lessons was sold on an auction for [Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity - WOŚP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Orchestra_of_Christmas_Charity) (the biggest charity in Poland that each year is raising money for sick children) in 2022.

I'm in a process of writing down each idea for the new Curriculum, I plan to publish all my notes for teaching programming. It may be ready before the end of 2022. So I will have all my notes public for the next edition of my programming course in 2023 for next WOŚP money rising finale. I plan to give the course to 4 people (4 auctions). I may also publish the notes after the next edition of the course.

The notes will be in form of Markdown files, I probbaly use some tool to generate PDF files that I will use during the course. I may also generate HTML files and publish it somewhere (e.g. GitHub pages or using GitBookor something similar).

The Curriculum will not be for learners but for teachers. But if some teacher will want to create version for learners he will be able to do that since the text is released under open license.
