Curriculum for teaching programming using JavaScript and p5.js library

## Status

I'm after first edition of teaching programming with JavaScript and P5.js for one person. The lessons was sold on an auction for [Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity - WOŚP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Orchestra_of_Christmas_Charity) (the biggest charity in Poland that each year is raising money for sick children) in 2022.

I'm in a process of writing down each idea for the new Curriculum, I plan to publish all my notes for teaching programming. It may be ready before the end of 2022. So I will have all my notes public for the next edition of my programming course in 2023 for next WOŚP money rising finale. I plan to give the course to 4 people (4 auctions). I may also publish the notes after the next edition of the course.

The notes will be in form of Markdown files, I probbaly use some tool to generate PDF files that I will use during the course.
